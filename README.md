# Ray Tracer
I made this ray tracer by first following the Ray Tracing in One Weekend tutorial (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), then decided to implement more functionality myself using the code from the tutorial as a base.

So far I have added:
- Emmisive materials
- Triangles (still requires work atm)
